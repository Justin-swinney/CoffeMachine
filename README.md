# JAVA-CoffeMachine
-  This project allowed me to better understand the basic OOP, its main concepts such as classes, class methods and attributes, and get a taste of Java. I gained practice working with methods, challenged myself with loops and conditions, and got more confident with OOP.

-  This was a small enjoyable project that taught me some concepts with OOP principals I was not fully confident in at the time!

-  The program is a console run input driven program that utilizes set resources at the start and modifies the values of the resources depending on the users input.
